# landing-page

Repo for "Landing Page" project for The Odin Project

In this project I demonstrate the use of basic HTML syntax and elements and CSS styling by creating a website landing page.
Confident use of flexbox is demonstrated.
Use of Git to commit changes to the GitHub repository is also demonstrated.
